# Big O

## Big O, Big Theta and Big Omega
- O (big O): upper bound on the time
- Ω (big omega): lower bound
- Θ (big theta): both O and Ω i.e. an algorithms is Θ(N) if it is both O(N) and Ω(N)

Note the difference between Big O, Big Theta, Big Omega and worst case, best case and expected case. **They are different!**
